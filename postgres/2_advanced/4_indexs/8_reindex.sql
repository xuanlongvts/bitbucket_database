Introduction to PostgreSQL REINDEX statement
In practice, an index can become corrupted and no longer contains valid data due to hardware failures or software bugs. To recover the index, you can use the REINDEX statement:

REINDEX [ ( VERBOSE ) ] { INDEX | TABLE | SCHEMA | DATABASE | SYSTEM } name;
In this syntax, the VERBOSE keyword is optional. When included, the statement displays a progress report when each index is reindexed.

To recreate a single index, you specify the index name after REINDEX INDEX clause as follows:

REINDEX INDEX index_name;
To recreate all the indexes of a table, you use the TABLE keyword and specify the name of the table:

REINDEX TABLE table_name;   
If you want to recreate all indices in a schema, you use the SCHEMA keyword followed by the schema name:

REINDEX SCHEMA schema_name;
To recreate all indices in a specific database, you specify the database name after the REINDEX DATABASE clause:

REINDEX DATABASE database_name;
The following statement recreates all indices on system catalogs in a specific database:

REINDEX SYSTEM database_name;
 REINDEX vs. DROP INDEX & CREATE INDEX
The REINDEX statement rebuilds the index contents from the scratch, which has the similar effect as drop and recreate of the index. However, the locking mechanisms between them are different.

The REINDEX statement:

Locks writes but not reads of the table to which the index belongs.
Takes an exclusive lock on the index that is being processed, which blocks reads that attempt to use the index.
The DROP INDEX & CREATE INDEX statements:

First, the DROP INDEX locks both writes and reads of the table to which the index belongs by acquiring an exclusive lock on the table.
Then, the subsequent CREATE INDEX statement locks out writes but not reads from the indexâ€™s parent table. However, reads might be expensive during the creation of the index.
In this tutorial, you have learned how to use the PostgreSQL REINDEX statement to drop and recreate one or more indices.
